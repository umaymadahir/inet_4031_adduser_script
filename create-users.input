Ultimate List Processing Language

The input file above is a colon (:) delimited file.
	Each line defines a user, and each user has 5 fields, separated by
	a ':'. The fields in left-to-right order are username, password,
	last name, first name and group list. '-' indicates an empty group
	list, and any lines that start with '#' are commented/disabled.

	In the Python code locate the Regex and other checks that process the
	input file delimiters. Notice that the group field after the final colon
	is also delimited by the comma.  A user can be a part of one, multiple, or	
	no groups.
